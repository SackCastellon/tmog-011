# The Mirror of Galadriel!
## Episode #011 - Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

Welcome to ***The Mirror of Galadriel***, one of the activities that will follow in the *The Fellowship of Code*. If you haven't been here before, this is a place where programming problems of different types will be proposed to be solved as fast as possible.

Without further ado, we leave you with the next problem. 

Good luck adventurers!

## Statement

Given a string containing digits from ``2-9`` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

***Constraints***
> ``0 <= digits.length <= 4``
> </br>``digits[i]`` is a digit in the range ``['2', '9']``.

## Examples

*Example 1*
> 
> **Input**: digits = "23"
> </br> **Output**: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

*Example 2*
> **Input**: digits = ""
> </br> **Output**: []

*Example 3*
> **Input**: digits = "2"
> </br> **Output**: ["a","b","c"]

## Extra

Run, you fools! No extra spicy stuff this time.
